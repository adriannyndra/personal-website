            <h2 class="article-title">Why you should be financially stable before owning a cat.</h2>

            <p>Cats are really cute, everyone love cats, everyone wants them, until they actually get one. I've lost count how many stories i've heard of cats being used as gifts for Birthdays or as presents for loved ones or be used as a gift in general just for them to be neglected after their irresponsible owners has been bored of 'em </p>
            <p>Not once or twice i've seen people that get out of their way to get a pet expecting a cute little fluffy company without a single thought about how prepared they are to maintain it, if the environment is good for the pet, or even if they have enough money for their essential healthcare needs etc. And once they actually get it they get struck and hit by the reality of pet care-taking, and most of the time it leads to negligence and at worse <b>abuse.</b></p>
            <p>Anger Management is also a huge deal for wannabe/future pet owners, also a must-do is to take account of your kids, and the people around us (neighbors, roommates) and anyone that might come contact to the cat can also be a huge factor. If you KNOW you have someone that can't handle pets around you, maybe think twice about owning one or at least communicate it before-hand. Numerous cases of pet poisoning by <i>evil</i> neighbors ok im getting sidetracked isnt this article suppose to talk about financial issues and the burden of cat ownership???</p>

            <p>Oh GPU's, an essential component for your PC, mainly used for gaming, video editing, and for your other graphical processing needs. Circa late 2020 when i got my first ever computer at 18 years old i was stoked, i got a 1050 ti which was a fairly okayish GPU for modern gaming at the time but i was fine with it because my plan was to buy a relatively entry level machine, and upgrade it later (i wasn't that much of a computer nerd back then but i know a thing or two). Since i wasn't a computer kinda guy i was fairly oblivious about how expensive these things are, my whole build net me around 5.8 juta rupiah which i thought was STILL very expensive (shoutout to my parents for sponsoring me) and made me feel bad. Little did i know, <i>that</i> pricing would be the cheapest computers will ever be for the next TWO years.</p>
